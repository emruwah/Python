# LIST

# 1. Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in a list.

# l1=[1,3,5,7,8]
# total=0

# for i in range(0,len(l1)):
#     total=total+l1[i]
# print("Some of all elements are: ",total)

# 2. Write a program to print all even numbers in a list.

# l1=[1,2,4,6,5,8,7,9,12,14,5,67,86]

# for i in l1:
#     if (i%2==0):
#         print(i)


# 3. Write a program to create a new list with the square of each element from an existing list.

# l1=[1,2,3,4,5]
# sq=[]
# for i in l1:
#     sq.append(i*i)
# print(sq)

# TUPLE

# 1. Write a program to iterate through a tuple and print each element.

# n=("Helen","Sophie","Jake","Milo")
# for i in n:
#     print(i)

# 2. Write a program to convert a tuple of numbers into a list of their squares.

# n=(1,2,3,4,5)
# for i in (n):
#     i*i
#     print(i)

# my_tuple=tuple(n)
# print("Tuple =",my_tuple)

# 3. Write a program to print elements of a tuple along with thier index.

# t=("silly","sat","saw")
# index=0





# DICTIONARY

# 1. Write a program to print all key-value pairs in a dictionary.

# s={1:"Susan",2:"Matty",3:"Sera"}
# for i in s:
#     print(s.get(i))

# print(s.keys())
# print(s.values())    
# 2. Write a program to print all keys and values seperately from a dictionary.

# s={1:"Susan",2:"Matty",3:"Sera"}
# for i in s:
#   print(s.get(i))

# print(s.keys())
# print(s.values())    

# 3. Write a program to increase each student's score by 5 points in a dictionary.
