# LISTS

# 1. What is a list in Python?

# A list in pythoni s used to store the sequence of various types of data.
# Alist can be defined as a collection of values or items of different types.
# Python lists are mutable types which implies that we may modify its element after it has been formed.
# The items in the list are seprated with the comma(,) and enclosed with the square bracket[]. 

# 2. How do you create an empty list?

# l1[]

# 3. How do you access elements in a list?

# To access elements in a list, we use list indexing and negative indexing. 

# 4. How do you add elements to a list?

# To add an element to a list, We use append(),insert(), and extend().

# 5. How do you remove elements from a list?

# To remove an element from a list, we use pop(), del() and remove().


# TUPLES


# 1. What is a tuple in Python?

# A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. 
# Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples
# cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets. 

# 2. How do you create a tuple?

# tuple_data=(1,2,3,4,5)
# print(tuple_data)

# 3. What is the main difference between a list and a tuple?

# The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples 
# use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

# 4. Can you modify a tuple once it is created?

# No, because tuples are immutable data type, which means that once they have been generated, their
# elements cannot be changed. 

# DICTIONARY

# 1. What is a dictionary in Python?

# Python dictionary is an ordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs.
# Here, keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.

# 2. How do you create an empty dictionary?

# di={}

# 3. How do you access values in a dictionary?

# Keys are used to access their corresponding values from the dictionary.
# eg. st={11:"helen",12:"gigi"}

# 4. How do you add key-value pairs to a dictionary?

# We can add elements to a dictionary using the name of the dictionary with [].
# eg. capital_city={"Nepal":"Kathmandu","England":"London"}
# print("int dic:" ,capital_city)
# capital_city["Japan"]="Tokyo"
# print("updated dict :", capital_city)

# 5. How do you remove key-value pairs from a dictionary?

# We use the del statement to remove an element from the dictionary.
# eg. st={11:"Stella",12:"Harry"}
# print("in dic :",st)
# del st[11]
# print("up dic :",st)


# SETS


# 1. What is a set in Python?

# A python set is the collection of the unordered items. Each element in the set must be unique,and
# the sets remove the duplicate elements. Sets are mutable which means it can be modified after its creation.

# 2. How do you create an empty set?

# a=set()
# print(type(a))

# 3. How do you add elements to a set?

# using add()
# eg. fruits=set("apple","orange","grape")
# print(fruits)
# fruits.add("kiwi")

# 4. How do you remove elements from a set?

# by using discard() or remove()
# eg.eg. fruits=set("apple","orange","grape")
# # print(fruits)
# fruits.remove("apple");
# print(fruits)

# 5. What is the difference between set and a list or tuple?


# IF STATEMENTS

# 1. What is an if statement in Python?
# 2. How do you use an if statement to make a decision in your code?
# 3. What is the syntax of an if statement?
# 4. What is an elif statement in Python?
# 5. When would you use an elif statement instead of an if statement?
# 6. Can you have multiple elif statements in a single if-elif-else block?


# FOR LOOPS

# 1. What is a for loop in Python?
# 2. How do you use a for loop to iterate over elements in a list?
# 3. Can you use a for loop to iterate over elements in a dictionary?


# WHILE LOOPS

# 1. What is a while loop in Python?
# 2. How do you use a while loop to repeat a block of code until a condition is met?
# 3. How do you avoid infinite loops when using while loops?
